### Development

The coding of the layout put my layout skills to the test, especially when laying out the background patterns for different screen sizes. I used a combination of CSS flexbox and grid for the responsive layout of the main content sections of the page. A user can log in and track their orders. Validations are done through react hook form and notifications via cogo toast and sweetalert.
